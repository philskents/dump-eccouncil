## Dump EC-Council

This site exists to help show the infosec community, managers, and recruiters that EC-Council are far from the only game in town when it comes to certification for information security professionals. Feel free to use this site to plan yourself a certification path, wave at a recruiter who is insisting that the CEH is the only penetration certification in the game, or to help justify a course or two to your manager.
